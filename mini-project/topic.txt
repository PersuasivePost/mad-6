QuickBite is a multi-vendor canteen pre-ordering system designed to eliminate long queues and waiting times in college canteens. Students can browse menus from multiple food stalls, place orders, and pay digitally through an integrated wallet or UPI. Vendors receive orders in real-time, manage their menus, and update order status from preparation to ready. A token-based pickup system displays ready orders on a central screen, ensuring smooth order collection. The system includes real-time order tracking, digital payment integration, vendor analytics, and an intuitive display interface for the canteen, making the entire food ordering process efficient and contactless.
